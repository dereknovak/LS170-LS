# The Internet

## Network
https://launchschool.com/lessons/4af196b9/assignments/268243e5

"At the most basic level, it's two devices connected in such a way that they can communicate or exchange data."

## Local Area Network (LAN)
https://launchschool.com/lessons/4af196b9/assignments/268243e5

"...multiple computers and other devices connected via a network bridging device such as a hub or, more likely, a switch. The computers are all connected to this device via network cables, and this forms the network."

## Router

"Routers are network devices that can route network traffic to other networks. Within a Local Area Network, they effectively act as gateways into and out of the network."'

## Protocol

"In simple terms, we can think of a protocol as a *system of rules**."

"In terms of computer networks, we can be a bit more specific: A set of rules that govern the exchange or transmission of data."

Why so many protocols?

1. "Different protocols were developed to address different aspects of network communication."
2. "Different protocols were developed to address the same aspect of network communication but differently for a specific use case."

### OSI Model

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model
The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a reference model from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that "provides a common basis for the coordination of standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection."

## Protocol Data Units (PDU)
https://launchschool.com/lessons/4af196b9/assignments/21ef33af

"...a Protocol Data Unit (PDU) is an amount or block of data transferred over a network. Different protocols or protocol layers refer to PDUs by different names. At the Link/ Data Link layer, for example, a PDU is known as a frame. At the Internet/ Network layer it is known as a packet. At the Transport layer, it is known as a segment (TCP) or datagram (UDP)."

### Header/Trailer

"The exact structure of the header and, if included, trailer varies from protocol to protocol, but the purpose of them is the same in each case: to provide protocol-specific metadata about the PDU."

# Wires, Cables, and WiFi (Khan Academy)

### Bit
Khan Academy
"A bit can be described as any pair of opposites: on or off, yes or no. We typically use a 1 (on) or a 0 (off)"
"These are the atoms of information."
"Today, we physically send bits by electricity, lights, and radio waves."

### Bandwidth

"Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be sent in a particular unit of time (typically, a second)."

### Bit Rate

"The number of bits that we can send over a given period of time, usually measured in seconds."

### Latency

"...latency is a measure of the time it takes for some data to get from one point in a network to another point in a network."

## Methods of Transportation

### Electricity (Copper wires)

- Cheap
- Signal loss

### Fiber Optic Cable

"A thread of glass engineered to reflect light."
- Really fast
- No signal loss
- Expensive

### Radio Waves
"Uses radio signal to send bits from one place to another."
- Translates 1's and 0's from binary to radio waves and back.
- Totally mobile
- Short range
